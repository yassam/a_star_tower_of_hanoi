A* search for the Tower of Hanoi using 3 rods.

I wrote this to work out how many steps needed for the optimal solution for
the 4 disk case. This was part (c) of Q1 on the final of ai-class.com
(Dec 2011).

This is my first implementation of A* search and although it seems to work for
this particular case (solving the 3-rod Tower of Hanoi game) it could have
bugs.

Amazingly, everything I needed to solve this was given in one algorithm which
I copied from a video lesson given by Peter Norvig given from the AI glass.
I didn't need to look at other code or anything else - it's all in the lessons!

TO RUN
------

Works on Python 2.7 (should work on earlier versions of Python - but haven't
tested on them).

Just type 'python astar_search.py' and enter the number of disks.

It will calculaute the number of steps for the optimal solution.

You can also display the list of steps needed to solve it.
